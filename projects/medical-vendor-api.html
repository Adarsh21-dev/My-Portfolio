        <section class="project-details">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Project Description</h2>
            <p>The Medical Vendor API Project is a comprehensive backend solution designed to power a mobile application
                platform that connects medical vendors with healthcare facilities and individual customers. This
                API-driven system was developed to address the growing need for streamlined procurement processes in the
                healthcare sector, particularly for medical supplies, equipment, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

            <p>The project was conceived after observing the inefficiencies in traditional medical supply chains, where
                procurement often involves multiple intermediaries, paper-based processes, and significant delays. By
                creating a direct digital channel between vendors and healthcare providers, this platform aims to reduce
                costs, improve delivery times, and enhance inventory management for all stakeholders.</p>

            <p>From an architectural perspective, the API follows RESTful design principles with a focus on scalability,
                security, and performance. The system is built using a modular approach that separates core
                functionalities into distinct services, including user management, product catalog, order processing,
                and analytics. This design allows for independent scaling of components based on demand and facilitates
                easier maintenance and feature additions.</p>

            <p>Security considerations were paramount throughout development, with implementation of industry-standard
                authentication protocols, data encryption, and role-based access controls to protect sensitive medical
                inventory information and user data. The API also incorporates comprehensive logging and monitoring
                capabilities to ensure system health and provide audit trails for regulatory compliance.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Pros and Cons</h2>
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean Architecture:</strong> The API implements a layered architecture that clearly
                    separates concerns between controllers, services, and data access layers. This separation enhances
                    maintainability and allows for independent testing of components. The modular design also
                    facilitates future extensions without disrupting existing functionality.</li>

                <li><strong>Comprehensive Authentication:</strong> Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based
                    access control that distinguishes between vendor accounts, customer accounts, and administrative
                    users. The token management system includes refresh token rotation and proper expiration handling to
                    maintain security while providing a seamless user experience.</li>

                <li><strong>Real-time Inventory Updates:</strong> The API incorporates WebSocket connections for
                    real-time inventory updates, allowing vendors to broadcast stock changes immediately to all
                    connected clients. This feature is particularly valuable for time-sensitive medical supplies with
                    limited availability.</li>

                <li><strong>Extensive Documentation:</strong> All API endpoints are thoroughly documented using
                    OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, providing interactive documentation that allows frontend developers
                    to understand and test endpoints without additional tools. The documentation includes example
                    requests, response schemas, and error handling information.</li>

                <li><strong>Optimized Query Performance:</strong> Database queries are optimized through careful index
                    design, query caching, and pagination strategies to ensure responsive performance even with large
                    datasets. The system can handle complex filtering and sorting operations without significant
                    performance degradation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deployment Complexity:</strong> As a self-initiated project, the deployment infrastructure
                    required significant setup and configuration. The multi-service architecture, while beneficial for
                    scalability, introduced complexity in terms of service discovery, load balancing, and monitoring
                    that would be more easily managed in a team environment with dedicated DevOps resources.</li>

                <li><strong>Database Schema Evolution:</strong> The initial database schema design required several
                    iterations as new requirements emerged during development. While migrations were implemented to
                    handle these changes, some early design decisions created constraints that required workarounds in
                    later stages.</li>

                <li><strong>Limited Mobile-specific Optimizations:</strong> The API, while functional for mobile
                    clients, could benefit from additional optimizations specifically for mobile environments, such as
                    more aggressive response compression, binary data formats for bandwidth-constrained scenarios, and
                    tailored response structures for different device capabilities.</li>

                <li><strong>Testing Coverage Gaps:</strong> While core functionality has comprehensive test coverage,
                    some edge cases and integration scenarios have less thorough testing due to time constraints. A more
                    systematic approach to test coverage would enhance reliability for production deployment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Tools and Frameworks Used</h2>
